Hello, contributor!

Thanks for your interest in react-step-builder.

In order to make any type of contribution to the library, please follow steps below:

1. Fork the repository and clone it in your local machine.

2. To add a feature the only file you want to interact is `lib-ts/index.tsx`. Make required changes in the file.

3. To test your changes, you can either write your tests with `react-test-renderer` or for manual testing, there is a create-react-app linked to the source code that the repository comes with.

4. For writing test cases, go to `tests/index.test.js` and add your cases. 

5. For manual testing, run `npm install` and `npm start` to run the CRA app.

6. In the `src` folder, find the related components to add your brand new features and start playing with it on the browser.

7. If everything looks good, create a Pull Request along with the library and test updates as well as updated CRA app that you did your manual testing in.

8. When your PR is accepted, library maintainer will download your code, build it, version it, and publish on the NPM registry.

9. Thank you for your time.
